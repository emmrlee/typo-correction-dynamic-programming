This program takes user inputted strings (may or may not be misspelled) as command line arguments and searches for their "least costly" typo corrections in a file of accepted words.
- "least costly" refers to the word that takes the least amount of effort to transform a potential misspelling into (aka the word that the user was most likely trying to spell)

This repo includes:
- the source code for the program
- a report describing the concept of dynamic programming and imprecise string matching for beginners
- the LaTex file for the report
